        <p>YOUR CONSENT</p>

          for you to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter
          subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing) or to participate in a
          particular activity (such as other promotions). You will be informed
          at each information collection point what information is required and
          what information is optional.
        </p>
        <p>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</p>
        <p>
          Except as otherwise stated, we may use your information to improve the
          content of our Website, customize the Website to your preferences,
          communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for our
          marketing and research purposes, and for the purposes specified in
          this Privacy Policy. If you provide personally identifiable
          information to this Website, we may combine such information with
          other actively collected information unless we specify otherwise at
          the point of collection. We may combine your personally identifiable
          information with passively collected information. We may disclose your
          personally identifiable information to other affiliates worldwide that
          agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition,
          we may disclose your personally identifiable information to third
          parties, located in the United States and/or any other country, but
          only: to contractors we use to support our business (e.g., fulfillment
          services, technical support, delivery services, and financial
          institutions), in which case we will require such third parties to
          agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy; in
          connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the
          business of this site to which the information relates, in which case
          we will require any such buyer to agree to treat it in accordance with
          this Privacy Policy; or where required by applicable laws, court
          orders, or government regulations. In addition, we will make full use
          of all information acquired through this site that is not in
          personally identifiable form.

        <p>
          Remember that the information provided by this site is for general
          background purposes and is not intended to be used in connection with,
          or as a substitute for, medical diagnosis or treatment by a trained
          professional. You should always consult your own physician about any
          healthcare questions you may have, especially before trying a new
          medication, diet, fitness program, or approach to health care issues.

        <p>SECURITY OF INFORMATION</p>
        <p>
          You can be assured that personal information collected through the
          Website is secure and is maintained in a manner consistent with
          current industry standards. The importance of security for all
          personal information associated with our customers is of utmost
          concern to us. Your personal information is protected in several ways.
          Your personal information resides on a secure server that only
          selected <span class="js_website-name"></span> employees and
          contractors have access to via password. In order to most efficiently
          serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled
          by established third-party banking, processing agents and distribution
          institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and
          authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process
          and ship your order. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
          internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
        </p>
        <p>PASSIVE INFORMATION COLLECTION</p>
        <p>
          As you navigate through a website, certain information can be
          passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing
          the information) using various technologies and means, such as
          Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational
          data collection. This Website may use Internet Protocol (IP)
          addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your
          Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is
          generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information,
          because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you
          connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular
          user's computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our
          server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for
          your computer to use in connecting to our Website, and administer and
          improve services to our consumers. A "cookie" is a bit of information
          that a website sends to your web browser that helps the site remember
          information about you and your preferences. "Session cookies" are
          temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web
          browser window or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies
          are used to improve navigation on websites and to collect aggregate
          statistical information. This Website uses session cookies.
          "Persistent cookies" are more permanent bits of information that are
          placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you
          delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your
          computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain
          information you have previously provided (e.g., username), helping to
          determine what areas of the website visitors find most valuable, and
          customizing the website based on your preferences. This Website uses
          persistent cookies. "Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs,
          clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies
          and tell the website server information such as the IP address and
          browser type related to the visitor's computer. This Website uses
          Internet tags. "Navigational data" ("log files," "server logs," and
          "clickstream" data) and "Internet Tags" are used for system
          management, to improve the content of the site, market research
          purposes, and to communicate information to visitors. This Website
          uses navigational data.
        </p>
        <p>Data Security</p>
        <p>
          We have put in place certain physical, electronic, and managerial
          procedures to help prevent unauthorized access and maintain data
          security. Payments are processed using secure 256-bit SSL Encryption.
          We will not share, trade or sell credit card information or personal
          information to any third party providers.
        </p>
        <p>OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</p>
        <p>
          Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. This
          Website is not intended for people under the age of 18. We never
          collect or maintain information at the Website from persons we know to
          be under age 18, and no part of our Website is designed to attract
          anyone under age 18. We encourage parents to talk to their children
          about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to
          websites.
        </p>
        <p>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy may change over time. We will notify you by e-mail
          to the e-mail address associated with your account whenever we make
          any substantive changes to this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept
          the changed version (for example, if you do not approve of a different
          way that we intend to use personal information) you may let us know by
          letter or e-mail. If you do not respond with any objections, we will
          assume that you consent to changes in the Privacy Policy. Changes will
          not apply retroactively to personal information that was collected
          before the changes to the Privacy Policy, except as may be required by
          law.
